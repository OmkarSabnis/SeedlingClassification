# SeedlingClassification
A multilabel classification project to classify the images of seedlings into 12 species using Convolutional Neural Networks <br>

To run this code, you will need: <br>
Numpy - Version: 1.14.3 <br>
Pandas - Version: 0.22.0 <br>
Keras - Version: 2.1.6 <br>
Tensorflow - Version: 1.5.0 or above <br>
Matplotlib - Version: 2.2.2 <br>
OpenCV - Version: 3.4.0 <br>
Glob, Math and Itertools modules <br>


To execute the classifier: <br>
Download the repository and run the CNN_ImageClassification.py file. 
Change the path to the dataset as per your system! 
The dataset is too large to be uploaded so the links are given below. Download the files there. 
The files are: <br>
train.zip - Has the training set (1.6 GB) <br>
test.zip - Has the testing set (85.97 MB) - In the repository <br>
sample_submission.csv - Sample Submission (5.13 KB) - In the repository <br>
